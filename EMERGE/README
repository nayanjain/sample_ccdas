Synthetic, clinical data summaries for 683 patients with a total of ~40,000 records
Data originally obtained from Cypress v1.0 and manually reviewed and modified.
Patient data parsed into XML files that conform to HL7’s Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) version 1.1 (July 2012) data structure standard
Specifically, Continuity of Care Document (CCD) template from C-CDA was used.
C-CDA standard is a Meaningful Use Stage 2 requirement §170.205(a)(3)
C-CDA standard available at: http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=258

Total of 683 files
One XML file per patient (=one CCD per patient)

XML files illustrate how to represent patient’s clinical summaries that originate from an EHR in a CCD document, machine readable format.

Each XML file contains several, detailed, section-level comments that complement C-CDA Implementation Guide and enhance users understanding on how clinical data is parsed into CCD document structure.
